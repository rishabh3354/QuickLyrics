    "\n\r\nOn the first page of our story\nThe future seemed so bright\nThen this thing turned out so evil\nI don't know why I'm still surprised\nEven angels have their wicked schemes\nAnd you take that to new extremes\nBut you'll always be my hero\nEven though you've lost your mind\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nWell, that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nWell, that's alright because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie, oh\nI love the way you lie\n\nNow there's gravel in our voices\nGlass is shattered from the fight\nIn this tug of war, you'll always win\nEven when I'm right\n'Cause you feed me fables from your head\nWith violent words and empty threats\nAnd it's sick that all these battles\nAre what keeps me satisfied\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nWell, that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nWell, that's alright because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie, oh\nI love the way you lie, oh\n\nSo maybe I'm a masochist\nI try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave\n'Til the walls are going up\nIn smoke with all our memories\n\nIt's morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face\nSmeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)\nHush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry\nThat you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me\nTry and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me\nRun out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy\nBaby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me\nThen tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me\nThen after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the\nDestructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we\nKnow that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs\nThat we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky\nTogether, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills\nYou hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?\nI may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count\nBut together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain\nOur love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling\nThis house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand\nSquare feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it\n'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nWell, that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\nWell, that's alright because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\n",
